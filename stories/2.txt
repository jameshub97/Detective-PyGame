SHOCKER 

Items. 
Electric Chord. Broken Glass. Cigarrete Carton. Cigarette Box

Electric Chord - Odd placement of an electric chord, it's far from a plug socket...

Broken Glass - Shard of glass (Blood Splatter indicates it was in ownership of someone defending themselves)

Cigarette Box - Almost empty carton of cigarettes 4 remain.

Cigaratte - Cigarette was lit, but was barely smoked. Seems they like there smokes so why would they waste 				this?
